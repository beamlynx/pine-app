## [0.7.1] - 2024-09-22

### Fixed

- When adding a pipe `|`, the expression was always being prettified. This wasn't allowing for adding pipes in the middle of the expression.

### Breaking

Changed how navigation works:

- `Tab` to focus on the graph. `Esc` or `Shift + Tab` to focus back on the input
- The focused frame is highlighted with a border
- When focused on the input, `Enter` fetches the results.
- When focused on the graph, `Enter` selects the current candidate. Any other character brings you back to the input.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-07-31

### Breaking

- Fetch results using `Ctrl + Enter` instead of `Enter`.

### Added
